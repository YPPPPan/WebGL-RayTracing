There are two lights in the view, one is a fixed light and the other one is a head light placed at the position of camera. You can change the head light by moving the camera in preview port and use keys IJKL to move fixed light. Change of light position will displayed immediately in preview port but you need to ray trace and get the result of change in ray tracing viewport.
